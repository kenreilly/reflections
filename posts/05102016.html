			<h3>The waking moment</h3>
			<p>
				As I begin to regain consciousness, I glance over at my phone and see that it's 3AM on May 10th, and I'm asking why I do this to myself. I'm lying there,
				wondering how I managed to lose nearly everything I had, and why I wasn't able to bounce back from this like I had come back from similar situations in the past.
			</p>

			<p><i>How did I let it get this bad? Why can't I stop thinking about this person?</i></p>
			<p>
				As I lay there in my bed, these questions circled through my mind, cutting through the drone of obsessive thoughts like
				"If only I could prove XYZ" or "If only she would hear me out" which had tormented me since she left.
			</p>

			<p><i>How the hell did this happen to me? I haven't been this bad off in years...</i></p>
			<p>
				I began to look back over the course of our brief 7-month relationship in which I had somehow gone from making almost $100K/yr as a software engineer,
				to doing odd jobs and unskilled manual labor in attempt to catch up on child support and get my car out of reposession.
			</p>


			<p>I give it one more round of rationalizing and bargaining, and then it hits me:</p>

			<p><i>How long have I been trying to prove myself to her, and why was I never good enough in the first place?</i></p>

			<p>
				Suddenly, it was as though the entire experience played out in fast-foward, showing me exactly where I had gone wrong at every stage.
				In one instant I went from feeling completely hopeless to feeling confident that I had not been nearly as bad as I was painted out to be.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the weeks leading up to (and immediately after) her departure, I had spent countless hours defending myself, questioning
				her passive-aggressive jabs at me on facebook, and clinging to the last few shreds of what I thought was a relationship. I was beginning
				to remember every moment I spent pleading for her to hear my side of the story, or trying to reassure her that if she just had faith, I would be
				back on top of my game in no time and we would be enjoying our successful life together once again.
			</p>

			<p>I looked back to our second or third date and recalled thinking to myself:</p>
			<p><i>Why does she talk about her ex-boyfriends so much, and why does she say they were all jerks? Man, this girl must've had a bad run. I'll change that.</i></p>

			<h3>Wrong.</h3>
			<p>
				What actually transpired was my slow de-evolution from a successful man into a grovelling fool who begged her to stop telling her friends and family
				that I was an emotionally abusive loser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suddenly I remembered every moment in which my confidence was eroded by gaslighting, blame-shifting, rewriting history, and all the other tactics that
				had left me so infuriated that I would begin to raise my voice in hopes that she would actually start to listening to me.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, this would only lead to more bad treatment with zero accountability. God help you if you can't take any more mental abuse and you begin to
				stand up for yourself in any way whatsoever. In a one-sided relationship, anything and everything you do wrong can and will be used against you, while your
				partner's faults are downplayed, justified, or even flat-out ignored.
			</p>

			<p>
				So now that the damage is done, what can I do? Well, the first thing I can do is share my experience with others to get it off my chest and to
				help other people look out for the red flags that indicate you're about to drive off a cliff.
			</p>

			<h3>Warning Signs</h3>

			<h4>Bringing up the past</h4>
			<p>
				If your new date is constantly re-hashing issues he or she has with previous relationships, it's a good sign that you are dealing with someone who
				will constantly re-hash problems with you throughout the course of your relationship. This person carries a lot of baggage and refuses to let go,
				meaning that you will likely never be forgiven for even the smallest mistake.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kindly address this issue with your date and politely suggest that you discuss more healthy topics than dwelling on past relationship problems. Any
				reasonable person will quickly understand that this isn't healthy. If this sparks some kind of debate or argument, run as fast as you can.
			</p>

			<h4>Lack of accountability</h4>
			<p>
				This often goes hand-in-hand with bringing up past relationship problems. Someone who tells you that every single one of their relationships in the past
				were abusive and they were the victim is almost always going to gaslight you and manipulate you into a state of uncontrollable anger at some point, in
				which all but the most enlightened individual is guaranteed to say something that he or she will come to regret (see bringing up the past above).
			</p>

			<p>
				This person takes no responsibility for any of the problems they have, and if you're like me you will end up shouldering the blame for every
				single confrontation between you two and constantly asking for acceptance and forgiveness. This type of individual fits well with the opposite type of partner
				(one who holds himself or herself accountable at all times) who they can then shovel the blame onto.
			</p>

			<p>
				My ex actually blamed me for losing 2 jobs, when in reality one went out of business and the other she quit to move across country, which was her idea in
				the first place. When I pointed this out to her, I got "I don't know what you're talking about. F*** off a**hole."
			</p>

			<h4>Geared for failure</h4>
			<p>
				From the very beginning of my last relationship, I noticed that somehow every major decision we made together had an exit strategy built-in. Needless to
				say, this set a very negative tone (which I foolishly ignored) where I felt that she was looking for a way out before we had even found a way in. Here are
				some examples:
			</p>

			<p><i>I know we can afford a nice home, but I want something cheap so that I can cover the rent in case we split or you bail on me.</i></p>
			<p><i>If we ever got married, I wouldn't want a joint bank account because I don't want to get screwed over if you leave me.</i></p>

			<p>
				While these may be valid points, they totally undermine the element of trust before it's even built. Every decision that gets made becomes an escape
				route, which indicates that either this person has serious trust issues or they have a track record of using and discarding people for their own gain.
			</p>

			<h4>Everyone is the enemy</h4>
			<p>This is a direct result of the above-mentioned lack of accountability.</p>
			<p>
				If your new partner is constantly complaining that he or she is always blown-off or stood up by friends, or that family, friends, and co-workers are
				constantly picking fights with them or doing things to anger them, these are probably true statements and most likely for a very good reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				High school bullying aside, no decent human being gets consistently picked on and/or blown off by others. What's likely happening is that these people are
				fed up with the kind of behavior you are about to experience and have chosen to either fight back or run. Sure, everyone has confrontations with people at
				times and you should take your partner's side in most cases, however if every single person in their life is a jerk to them, it's time to ask yourself why.
			</p>


			<h4>Conditional love</h4>
			<p>
				Your partner wants to cuddle / watch a movie / have sex / go to the coffee shop, and of course you enjoy doing all these things with them so you make your best
				effort to schedule them into your day or even drop what you're doing if it's not critical or work-related so that you can fulfill your partner's needs and enjoy
				time with them. It's a wonderful experience to share your life with someone you love, so why wouldn't you make the effort to do so?
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything seems great, until you ask for your partner to reciprocate this love and provide you with some attention or affection. He or she stares into facebook
				while you try to have a meaningful conversation about something important to you. You are ignored or blown off for days until you finally can't take it anymore
				and start asking why, only to find out you did something wrong days ago. Love and affection become a transactional tool to keep you in check.
			</p>

			<p>
				This isn't love, this is using another human being for one's own personal needs while disregarding theirs. If you try to politely discuss this critical issue
				with your partner but he or she stares blindly into facebook or netflix and acts annoyed by your presence, get out and find someone who actually appreciates you.
			</p>

			<h4>Backstabbing</h4>
			<p>
				This is probably one of the most directly painful experiences you will face in a one-sided relationship. You supply your partner with the love and affection they
				need when asked for, while they blow you off as above. However, instead of confronting them directly about it, you find out from someone else that you are in
				trouble and being punished for your lack of perfection.
			</p>

			<p>
				In my case, I saw facebook notifications popping up on the living room TV with her complaining to her ex-boyfriend about me and seeking his emotional support,
				along with my friends forwarding text messages they received from her trying to convince them that I was abusive towards her, just to name a few examples.
			</p>

			<p>
				Nobody in a relationship should be seeking comfort from previous relationships, especially for conflicts which they won't even address with their current partner.
				This is emotional infidelity and is a good indication that this person is likely to cheat, leave you for someone, or triangulate you with a new love interest.
			</p>

			<h3>Nuked from space</h3>
			<h4>Brace for impact</h4>
			<p>
				You can guarantee that when he or she finally exhausts your energy supply, kicks you when you're down, and walks off, they will make absolutely sure
				that you and the rest of the world know what a loser you are and that it's all your fault. Be prepared for insults, public humiliation, having your friends
				turned against you, and a slew of other manipulative tactics that will tear your self-esteem to shreds. Get out while you can still think.
			</p>

			<h4>The fallout</h4>
			<p>Once the dust has settled, you take a look around at your life and realize you have become the very thing they claimed every other partner was: a loser.</p>
			<p>
				In my case, I had lost contact with my kids, lost business from not being able to think clearly, my friends had little respect for me for having allowed
				myself to be treated like a doormat, I had burned up all my savings trying to put out fires, and I was severely depressed and had picked up smoking to
				calm my nerves and prevent myself from self-destructing once and for all. The worst part of all? This is what was going through my head:
			</p>
			<p><i>I have to get back on my feet so she wlil come back to me someday...</i></p>
			<p><i>I know she loves me deep down inside and is just having a difficult time showing it because she's stressed / scared / angry / etc.</i></p>

			<p>
				Here I was, having lost everything, and I felt that I owed the person who had caused me so much pain and regret! Somehow I felt that if she only came
				back to me and gave me another chance, I would prove myself to her once more and we could be happy together again. But looking back, I realize she was
				rarely happy with anything, and generally looked on the negative side of things.
			</p>

			<p>
				Recognizing that these thought patterns are what create your agnoizing emotional state is the first step to adopting a new approach to life and
				learning how to value yourself, overcome codependency issues, and build yourself into the person you were meant to be.
			</p>

			<h3>Recovery</h3>
			<h4>The first step</h4>

			<p>
				If you are suffering from a one-sided relationship (or breakup from one) and you've read this far, congratulations, for you have taken the first step
				towards healing and repairing the damage done to your self-worth and self-respect. Just knowing that this isn't a healthy way to live, and that there
				are other people who have experienced what you're going through, is a productive mindset and will set you on the fast track to success in overcoming
				your situation and redefining yourself as a strong, healthy individual in mind, body, and spirit.
			</p>

			<h4>Thinking objectively</h4>
			<p>
				Whenever you catch yourself longing for the love and passion you should be enjoying in a healthy relationship, whether it be because you're being
				stonewalled and ignored / given the cold shoulder, or because you held your partner accountable for their actions and they bolted on you, remember
				that there are people in this world who would love to give you the affection you deserve, even if you are less than perfect (which everyone is).
			</p>
			<p>
				Chances are, your partner has convinced you that you totally blew it, and therefore you are left feeling the loss of someone you feel that you can't
				replace. Perhaps this person would indeed be irreplaceable, if they had any desire to see anything positive about you in return. Perhaps you have met
				the right person but at the wrong time, in which case you can either continue to self-destruct waiting for them to grow up and take responsibility for
				their half of your relationship issues, or heal and find someone who can appreciate you the way you appreciate others, with unconditional love,
				understanding, forgiveness, and the will to accept a partner for both the positive and negative traits they have.
			</p>

			<h4>Perfection is a myth</h4>
			<p>
				Your partner or ex is not a perfect individual, regardless of how much effort they have put into convincing you that they have done no wrong whatsoever.
				Neither of you are perfect, and all you have to remember is that you're better off in life as an individual who posesses the ability
				to self-reflect, take accountability, and learn from your mistakes.
			</p>

			<p>
				If someone has walked out of your life claiming that you were totally at fault and that they had nothing to do with it, thank them for creating a
				space in your life for a rational human capable of genuine reciprocal love and affection which you can both enjoy together. Do your best to not focus on
				feelings of anger, resentment, jealousy, or betrayal, or else you run the risk of causing further damage to yourself and becoming so damaged that you too
				begin to treat others the way you've been treated.
			</p>

			<p>
				Rise above and take the high road, trying not to take satisfaction in the inevitable fact that sooner or later the person who devalued you will run out
				of people to use and take advantage of, and will most likely attract these same things into their life, even if only from bringing out the worst in others
				the way they worked so hard to bring out the worst in you. They will get more revenge on themselves than you could ever exact upon them, simply by having
				to eventually face the consequences of their actions. Focus on being the best person you can be and attracting someone who genuinely loves and respects you.
			</p>

			<h4>Enjoy your life</h4>
			<p>
				Begin doing things that are good and healthy for you, regardless of whether or not your partner or ex would or would have approved of them. Mine couldn't
				stand it when I would do anything on the computer that wasn't directly involved in work for a client, despite the fact that when we met I was self-employed
				and spent at least 10-15 hours per week on accounting, research, study, and generally trying to advance the state of the software industry. She criticized me
				for playing guitar instead of spending time with her one day even though we both were well aware she was leaving me the next day. Today, I can enrich and
				advance my life guilt-free with no fear of being criticized for it.
			</p>

			<h4>Change your self-image</h4>
			<p>
				This is perhaps the most critical step to recovering from an off-balance relationship. If you have given up all the things that make you unique and amazing
				as a person in order to satisfy your partner's insatiable appetite for control, chances are you feel pretty horrible about yourself, and your entire life will
				reflect how you feel because your thoughts create your emotions, your emotions drive your actions, your actions create your consequences, and these
				consequences create the experience of your life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reverse the downward spiral of self-loathing and understand that when someone else refuses to see the value in you, it says much more about them than it does
				you. See the good in yourself and you will begin to feel awesome and attract more people into your life who also want to feel awesome and share these great
				experiences with you and the rest of the world. If your partner (or ex) doesn't posess the self-awareness to understand these concepts, then either they can
				choose to open themselves up to having a better attitude, or you can choose to find someone who will.
			</p>

			<p>
				Karma is a very real and powerful force that drives the underlying mechanics of the universe. If someone devalued you and walked out on you in a power play,
				rest assured that they won't be going anywhere for a while. Send them a snickers and wish them luck, because they will need as much of it as they can get. If
				they do somehow manage to have some deeply moving experience in which they become self-aware, accept their humble apology but only if it has real and tangible
				value, and do not accept this person back into your life without both of you having some serious time to heal, reflect, and seek counseling or some other
				spiritually healing work.
			</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				At the end of the day, you are responsible for who you are, what you think, how you feel, and why you are where you are now. You can only draw respect and love
				from people if you are willing to provide those things for yourself and live a life that is in harmony with these values. Learn to unconditially forgive both
				yourself and others so that you may let go of blocking negative emotions and open your heart to receive the abundance you deserve.
