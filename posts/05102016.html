			<h3>The waking moment</h3>
			<p>
				As I begin to regain consciousness, I glance over at my phone and see that it's 3AM on May 10th, and I'm asking why I do this to myself. I'm lying there,
				wondering how I managed to lose nearly everything I had, and why I wasn't able to bounce back from this like I had come back from similar situations in the past.
			</p>

			<p><i>How did I let it get this bad? Why can't I stop thinking about this person?</i></p>
			<p>
				As I lay there in my bed, these questions circled through my mind, cutting through the drone of obsessive thoughts like
				"If only I could prove XYZ" or "If only she would hear me out" which had tormented me since she left.
			</p>

			<p><i>How the hell did this happen to me? I haven't been this bad off in years...</i></p>
			<p>
				I began to look back over the course of our brief 7-month relationship in which I had somehow gone from making almost $100K/yr as a software engineer,
				to doing odd jobs and unskilled manual labor in attempt to catch up on child support and get my car out of reposession.
			</p>


			<p>I give it one more round of rationalizing and bargaining, and then it hits me:</p>

			<p><i>How long have I been trying to prove myself to her, and why was I never good enough in the first place?</i></p>

			<p>
				Suddenly, it was as though the entire experience played out in fast-foward, showing me exactly where I had gone wrong at every stage.
				In one instant I went from feeling completely hopeless to feeling confident that I had not been nearly as bad as I was painted out to be.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the weeks leading up to (and immediately after) her departure, I had spent countless hours defending myself, questioning
				her passive-aggressive jabs at me on facebook, and clinging to the last few shreds of what I thought was a relationship. I was beginning
				to remember every moment I spent pleading for her to hear my side of the story, or trying to reassure her that if she just had faith, I would be
				back on top of my game in no time and we would be enjoying our successful life together once again.
			</p>

			<p>I looked back to our second or third date and recalled thinking to myself:</p>
			<p><i>Why does she talk about her ex-boyfriends so much, and why does she say they were all jerks? Man, this girl must've had a bad run. I'll change that.</i></p>

			<h3>Wrong.</h3>
			<p>
				What actually transpired was my slow de-evolution from a successful man into a grovelling fool who begged her to stop telling her friends and family
				that I was an emotionally abusive loser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suddenly I remembered every moment in which my confidence was eroded by gaslighting, blame-shifting, rewriting history, and all the other tactics that
				had left me so infuriated that I would begin to raise my voice in hopes that she would actually start to listening to me.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, this would only lead to more bad treatment with zero accountability. God help you if you can't take any more mental abuse and you begin to
				stand up for yourself in any way whatsoever. In a one-sided relationship, anything and everything you do wrong can and will be used against you, while your
				partner's faults are downplayed, justified, or even flat-out ignored.
			</p>

			<p>
				So now that the damage is done, what can I do? Well, the first thing I can do is share my experience with others to get it off my chest and to
				help other people look out for red flags that indicate pitfalls which you can then drive around, or possibly hit the brakes and get out of there fast.
			</p>

			<h3>Warning Signs</h3>

			<h4>Bringing up the past</h4>
			<p>
				If your new date is constantly re-hashing issues he or she has with previous relationships, it's a good sign that you are dealing with someone who
				will constantly re-hash problems with you throughout the course of your relationship. This person carries a lot of baggage and refuses to let go,
				meaning that you will likely never be forgiven for even the smallest mistake.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kindly address this issue with your date and politely suggest that you discuss more healthy topics than dwelling on past relationship problems. Any
				reasonable person will quickly understand that this isn't healthy. If this sparks some kind of debate or argument, run as fast as you can.
			</p>

			<h4>Lack of accountability</h4>
			<p>
				This often goes hand-in-hand with bringing up past relationship problems. Someone who tells you that every single one of their relationships in the past
				were abusive and they were the victim is almost always going to gaslight you and manipulate you into a state of uncontrollable anger at some point, in
				which all but the most enlightened individual is guaranteed to say something that he or she will come to regret (see bringing up the past above).
			</p>

			<p>
				This person takes no responsibility for any of the problems they have, and if you're like me you will end up shouldering the blame for every
				single confrontation between you two and constantly asking for acceptance and forgiveness. This type of individual fits well with the opposite type of partner
				(one who holds himself or herself accountable at all times) who they can then shovel the blame onto.
			</p>

			<p>
				My ex actually blamed me for losing 2 jobs, when in reality one went out of business and the other she quit to move across country, which was her idea in
				the first place. When I pointed this out to her, I got "I don't know what you're talking about. F*** off a**hole."
			</p>

			<h4>Geared for failure</h4>
			<p>
				From the very beginning of my last relationship, I noticed that somehow every major decision we made together had an exit strategy built-in. Needless to
				say, this set a very negative tone (which I foolishly ignored) where I felt that she was looking for a way out before we had even found a way in. Here are
				some examples:
			</p>

			<p><i>I know we can afford a nice home, but I want something cheap so that I can cover the rent in case we split or you bail on me.</i></p>
			<p><i>If we ever got married, I wouldn't want a joint bank account because I don't want to get screwed over if you leave me.</i></p>

			<p>
				While these may be valid points, they totally undermine the element of trust before it's even built. Every decision that gets made becomes an escape
				route, which indicates that either this person has serious trust issues or they have a track record of using and discarding people for their own gain.
			</p>

			<h4>Everyone is the enemy</h4>
			<p>This is a direct result of the above-mentioned lack of accountability.</p>
			<p>
				If your new partner is constantly complaining that he or she is always blown-off or stood up by friends, or that family, friends, and co-workers are
				constantly picking fights with them or doing things to attack them, these are probably true statements and most likely for a very good reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				High school bullying aside, no decent human being gets consistently picked on and/or blown off by others. What's likely happening is that these people are
				fed up with the kind of behavior you are about to experience and have chosen to either fight back or run. Sure, everyone has confrontations with people at
				times and you should take your partner's side in most cases, however if every single person in their life is a jerk to them, it's time to ask yourself why.
			</p>

			<h4>Nuked from space</h4>
			<p>
				You can guarantee that when he or she finally exhausts your energy supply, kicks you when you're down, and walks off, they will make absolutely sure
				that you and the rest of the world know what a loser you are and that it's all your fault. Be prepared for insults, public humiliation, having your friends turned against you,
				and a slew of other manipulative tactics that will tear your self-esteem to shreds. Get out while you can still think.
