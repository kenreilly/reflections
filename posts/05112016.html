			<h3>Intelligence</h3>

			<h4>Creation</h4>
			<p>
				At any moment, we are always one thought away from changing everything. The next thought that comes into my mind could be anything,
				and with it comes an opportunity to decide how I choose to percieve that thought and what I wish to do with it, thereby giving me
				the choice to direct myself in any way I desire.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's easy to look around and see proof that intelligent thought drives the creation of reality. Simply observe the objects around you
				and notice that nearly all of them were created by people who decided to create them. Of course, the smartphone or computer you're using
				didn't appear before someone decided to invent it. Humans make things after thinking about how to make them and deciding to do it, thereby
				the physical universe is bound by how we think about it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Higher intelligence creates higher forms of reality, such as planets, solar systems, and galaxies. Tapping into this higher intelligence is
				no more difficult than planting a tree. When I plant a tree, I am co-creating with the force which causes the tree to absorb energy
				and matter and grow in the exact location where planted it. In this way, we co-create our reality, both with each other and with a higher being.
			</p>

			<h4>Perception</h4>
			<p>
				Everything in physical or non-physical form begins and ends with a perception. How I percieve something, be it a concept, idea, physical object,
				spiritual entity, emotion, or anything else, will determine how I decide to think about it, and therefore how it affects me, which in turn changes
				how I affect the things I percieve.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this regard, even things which do not appear to exist in three dimensional space do indeed exist, because how I perceive some intangible thought
				is what determines how my brain will wire neurological pathways which forms a physical construct of this thought in my mind. When I believe in a
				higher power, for example, neurons begin to form and/or re-wire themselves to reflect this, and my actions are then driven by my choice to believe
				in this concept, which then directly influences the actions I take in the physical realm.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is logical proof that believing in something indeed creates it in some form, and the ability to believe in anything whatsoever
				(intelligent thought) is the driving force behind all reality, physical or otherwise.
			</p>

			<h4>Observation</h4>
			<p>
				Observation is simply the act of perception. We observe whether we choose to or not, for even the decision to observe nothing leaves me with the
				observation that I am observing nothing. Being the one who observes means that I cannot be defined in any simpler form, because I am able to
				observe all things, including my mind, body, the smallest subatomic particle, the effects of an electromagnetic wave, or a distant sun millions
				of light years away. I can even choose to observe a concept such as an emotion, which then through perception will render this emotion into some
				physical form.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am not my body, because I could choose to spend the next month either eating cheeseburgers and watching movies, or eating paleo and doing yoga.
				My body will be radically different based on whichever I choose, but I will still have the equal ability to observe myself either way.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am not my mind, because I can choose to focus on playing video games for the next week or learning a new scientific concept instead. The
				contents of my mind will be different based on which choice I make, however I will remain the one who is able to continue observing and making choices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, I exist only in observation, and I create myself in physical and mental form based on my observations and perceptions of myself, others, and
				all things both tangible and intangible.
			</p>
